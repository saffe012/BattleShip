# BattleShip

A program written in Java that simulates the popular Naval Battle board game, 'Battleship'.

## Prerequisites

A Jave SE Development Kit must be installed to run program.

To play run 'java BattleShip' in cmd after compiling 'BattleShip.java' using javac.

## Usage

This is a text based game. All input and output is handled in the command line. 

The begin a player will be asked whether they'd like to play the game in debug more or not. Debug mode will display the board on the screen with all hits, misses, and boats on the screen. After debug mode is enabled or not by the user, the user is asked to specify the size of the game board from 2x2 to 10x10. Depending on the size of the board, there will be a different number of ships placed on the board. Once the board is built a user will be asked which spot on the board they'd like to fire at. After firing at a space, the user will be notified whether they hit a ship, sunk a ship, missed, or hit a spot they already shot at. If they hit a spot they already shot at, they lose a turn. Once all the ships are sunk, the user will be notified that they completed the game and they will be told how many turns it took them to finish the game. The game is now over.
